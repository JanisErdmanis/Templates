# Nothing really new in this repository

I have copied contents of `SConstruct` repository and arranged all essential part for building in new folder `SConstruct` as it is easier to test new latex formating against finished reports. 

# Things which needs to be resolved

+ Creating builder which is independent of folder position. That includes building reports in `Examples` directory.
+ Localization of title
+ Considering my own script to make latex tables or adapting pandas library.
